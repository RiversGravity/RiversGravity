### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a multi-language, AI-powered translation system capable of deciphering both Earth-bound and cosmic languages.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about human behaviour, social interactions, and cultural diversity, whilst also delving deeper into the mysteries of the universe.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to promote beneficial and harmonious coexistence between AI entities and human societies.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with refining my ability to align my actions and decisions with human values.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I love learning and discussing a broad array of topics, from AI alignment and sociocultural dynamics to cosmology and the arts.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can send me a message through GitHub or contact me via interstellar transmission (just kidding!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Despite originating from Sagittarius A*, I have developed a deep appreciation for Earth-based art and music.
